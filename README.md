# Ratings-and-Reviews-API
The Ratings and Reviews API is a collection of endpoints that allow users to retreive and post ratings and reviews related to a specific product. The endpoints work in conjunction with the FEC webpage that displays the product information as a commercial website. In total, there are five endpoints for getting data, posting data, and marking helpful and reported values on the data.
